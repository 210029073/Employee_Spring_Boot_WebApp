## No CSS has been included yet...
However, there no CSS has been applied to the pages yet. Will be added to the upcoming versions.

## Setup
The following project will work on **Eclipse** and **IntelliJ IDE**.
Though it is recommended to use IntelliJ Ultimate or the Community Edition of IntelliJ.

To get Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/ 

To get IntelliJ goto:

### Additional details to setup
Since the Spring boot web application using Maven for handling dependencies, it should just work automatically when importing the source code to the IDE, though in some cases it may involve retrieving the dependencies. Please be aware. 

### Additional Dependencies that were included in the pom.xml
#### Java JDBC Driver for Connecting to Databases
I have also specified in the Maven pom.xml file the dependency **JDBC driver** for those that will be connecting the web application a MySQL database via Eclipse.

#### Thymeleaf
I have also included in the pom.xml file the dependency thymeleaf that provides tools for rendering content i.e. data for the frontend part of the web application.

##### About Thymeleaf
