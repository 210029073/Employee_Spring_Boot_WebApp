# Employee_Spring_Boot_WebApp
A simple employee web application written in Java provided by the Spring Boot framework which is a Java based framework that can delete, search, and add a new employee. However, there no CSS has been applied to the pages yet. Will be added to the upcomming versions.

##Setup
The following project will work on **Eclipse** and **IntelliJ IDE**.
Though it is recommended to use IntelliJ Ultimate or the Community Edition of IntelliJ.
I have also specified in the Maven pom.xml file the dependency **JDBC driver** for those that will be connecting the web application a MySQL database.

##Additional Notes
Feel free to make changes to the source code.
